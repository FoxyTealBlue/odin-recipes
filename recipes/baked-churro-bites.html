        <p>Baked Churro Bites – “Just As Good, If Not Better?</p>
        <p>I’m not a very skeptical person in general, but whenever I hear about a 
            <br>baked version of a recipe that’s usually deep-fried, and they say it’s, 
            <br>“just as good, if not better,” I simply don’t believe it. And, that’s 
            <br>because it’s never true. But, every once in a while, the results are so 
            <br>close that we can forgive a little bit of hyperbole, and these baked 
            <br>churros are a great example.</p>
        <p>No, they don’t have the same crispy, crusty exterior the fried version 
            <br>features, but what they do have is pretty much everything else. The 
            <br>interior texture, and flavor are virtually identical; and if you use a 
            <br>star tip to pipe them, so is the appearance. Plus, they’re both perfect 
            <br>dipped into thick, rich, Spanish-style hot chocolate, which may be the 
            <br>most important similarity.</p>
        <p>You hear people say that churro dough is identical to the ubiquitous “pate 
            <br>choux,” but I don’t agree. If you do use that classic French dough, you’ll 
            <br>get something that’s lighter, eggier, and much more hollow. So, I’ve 
            <br>tweaked the proportions to get something a little denser, and I think 
            <br>closer to a “real” churro. By the way, stay tuned for the Spanish-style 
            <br>hot chocolate, which will be the next video. But, no matter how you decide 
            <br>to enjoy yours, I really hope you give these a try soon. Enjoy!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cups water</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 packed tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter for brushing on before sugaring</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cinnamon Sugar:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, butter, brown sugar, and salt in a saucepan over medium 
                <br>heat and bring to a simmer. Add flour all at once and cook, stirring, 
                <br>until a soft, sticky dough ball forms, and a starchy film coats the 
                <br>bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking for about 1 minute more, scraping the film off the 
                <br>bottom of the pan as you stir. You won’t have a clean bottom surface, 
                <br>but some will be reabsorbed by the dough.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a bowl and let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add in vanilla extract and eggs, 1 at a time, and mix in using a spatula. 
                <br>The mixture will separate at first, but eventually it will smear 
                <br>together into a sticky dough.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets 
                <br>with silpat mats or parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip (I used a number 
                <br>356 tip). Pipe out 3 to 4 inch ropes onto the prepared baking sheets, 
                <br>spaced a few inches apart. Use the back of a knife to “cut” through 
                <br>dough at the end of each piping, to get a clean end. Since this makes 
                <br>28 to 30 bite-sized churros, pipe 14 to 15 onto each baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Once piped, spray tops of the churros with vegetable oil spray, and then 
                <br>spray water generously all over the pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until churros are puffed and the edges are 
                <br>browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Turn off the oven, and open the door for 
                <br>about 10 seconds to vent heat. Close the door, leaving it open about 
                <br>8 to 12 inches, and let churros rest in the oven for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, and working in batches of 6 at a time, brush them 
                <br>lightly with melted butter, and then toss to coat in a bag of 
                <br>cinnamon sugar.</li>
        </ol>
